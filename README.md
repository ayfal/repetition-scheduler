# repetition-scheduler
Helps mastering study materials.<br>
Fits itself to your memory.

After messing around for several years with a lot of the spaced repetition algorithms out there,<br>
I've come to conclude that while their basis is pretty solid, they're mostly based on speculation,<br>
and therefor it's no wonder they don't fit themselves quite right to our memory.<br>
Plus they suffer from what I personally found to be bad design, which they inherited from one famous and pretty flawed system.<br>
So after I figured out there's no real way to predict the right time for reviewing each piece of information you want to master, <br>
I've thrown together this piece of code in a spreadsheet, which is based purely on the single known fact in this area,  
which is that spacing out repetitions can increase the duration of memories,<br>
and is designed in a way I find much more useful for academic studies.<br>
After figuring this out, I also figured out you could implement a slightly less affective system with pen and paper,<br>
which I used for quite some time with satisfying results, and I plan to post it here as well (coming soon! maybe)

You'll need a computer and Excel, as it's written in VBA.
