# repetition-scheduler
Helps to remember study materials. 
Fits itself to your memory.

After messing around for several years with a lot of the spaced repetition algorithms out there,
I've come to conclude that while their basis is pretty solid, they're mostly based on speculation,
and therefor it's no wonder they don't fit themselves quite right to our memory.
Plus they suffer from what I personally found to be bad design, which they inherited from one famous and pretty flawed system.
So after I figured out there's no real way to predict the right time for reviewing each piece of information you want to master, 
I've thrown together this piece of code in a spreadsheet,
which is based purely on the single known fact that spacing out repetitions can increase the duration of memories,
and is designed in a way I find much more useful for academic studies.
After figuring this out, I also figured out you could do a slightly less affective system with pen and paper,
which I used for quite some time with satisfying results, and I plan to post here as well (coming soon! maybe)
